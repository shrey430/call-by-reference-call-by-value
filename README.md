__Call By Value


In call by value method, the value of the actual parameters is copied into the formal parameters. In other words, we can say that the value of the variable is used in the function call in the call by value method. We can not modify the value of the actual parameter by the formal parameter. Different memory is allocated for actual and formal parameters since the value of the actual parameter is copied into the formal parameter.

__Call By Reference


The address of the variable is passed into the function call as the actual parameter. The value of the actual parameters can be modified by changing the formal parameters since the address of the actual parameters is passed. The memory allocation is similar for both formal parameters and actual parameters. All the operations in the function are performed on the value stored at the address of the actual parameters, and the modified value gets stored at the same address.
